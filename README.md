# Hiking notes app

## Note

This was originally a private group project hosted on GitLab, but I got the permission to clone the repo here. Some of the code might be outdated since I've cloned it before we had our last sprint (currently on the 4th release, 11th sprint).

Since the project isn't currently deployed, I added some screenshots to showcase the functionality. I still have the project setup locally so I could always showcase it myself if there'd be a need for that.
